## Overview

### Guidelines

The project must satisfy the following requirements:

- Allow the user to play a quiz game, by choosing the category, the challenge level and the number of questions which will then be returned by the [OpenTDB API](https://opentdb.com/), and by selecting the answers and checking the final score

## My process

### Built with

- React
- CSS3 custom properties
- Mobile first development
- Flexbox
- Axios

### What I learned

I learned how to build a webapp that allows users to play a simple quiz game, how to properly manage data from an API via the `useEffect` hook, and to manage the state of the application with `useState` first and then `useReducer` hooks.

### Continuous development

I'll look up to this project wneh I'll develop new web apps with React, because it allowed me to implement many features that are used across many applications
